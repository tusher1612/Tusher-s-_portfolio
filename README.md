To compile your project for production, execute:

```

This command triggers a series of processes that package your code, assets, and other necessary files, ultimately creating a production-ready version of your project. After running the command, you'll find the compiled files within the `dist` folder.

It's based on the **[React](https://reactjs.org/)** framework created by Jordan Walke, and the **[Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)** framework created by Mark Otto and Jacob Thorton.

Additional frameworks and plugins used include:

- **Font Awesome**: A library of free vector icons.
